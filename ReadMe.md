# MedCEG: Reinforcing Verifiable Medical Reasoning with Critical Evidence Graph

**MedCEG** is a framework that augments medical language models with clinically valid reasoning pathways by explicitly supervising the reasoning process through a Critical Evidence Graph (CEG). 

## 🚀 Model Architecture & Pipeline

Our approach consists of two main stages:
1.  **Cold-Start**: We transform structured evidence graphs into natural language to teach the model logical dependencies.
2.  **Graph-guided Reinforcement Learning**: We use a Critical Evidence Graph (CEG) to provide dense, process-oriented rewards.

## 🛠️ Training with VeRL

We utilize [**VeRL**](https://github.com/volcengine/verl) (Volcengine Reinforcement Learning) for the RLHF/RLAIF stage. Our specific **Process Reward** functions provided in the `code/reward` directory.

### 1. Start the Embedding Service

To ensure efficient calculation of semantic similarity during training without reloading the model repeatedly, we use a standalone FastAPI server for embeddings. This server manages a pool of `BGE-LARGE-EN-V1.5` models across available GPUs.

**Setup:** Update the `BGE_PATH` variable in `code/server/EmbeddingServer.py` to point to your local model path.

**Launch:**

```Bash
python code/server/EmbeddingServer.py
```

*Note: Ensure this server is accessible to your training nodes (default port 8000).*

### 2. Integration with VeRL

The files in `code/reward/` contain the custom reward functions tailored for MedCEG.

- **`GraphReward.py`**: Implements the core logic for calculating the composite reward: `Node Coverage`, `Structural Correctness`, and `Chain Completeness`.
- **`GraphMCQ.py`** & **`GraphOpenendQuestion.py`**: These scripts contain the `compute_score()` function, which acts as the primary interface for the reward model.

The reward function evaluates:

1. **Format Reward**: Checks for proper `<think>...</think>` tag usage.
2. **Accuracy Reward**: Checks the final answer against Ground Truth.
3. **Process Reward**: Extracts the graph from the `<think>` trace and compares it against the Ground Truth CEG using the Embedding Server.

## 💻 Inference

The `Inference.py` script allows you to test the model. Our model weights are open-sourced at [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/LinjieMu/MedCEG).

```Python
import transformers
import torch

# 1. Load the model and tokenizer
model_id = "ICLRAnonymous/MedCEG"
tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
model = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_id,
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    device_map="auto",
)

# 2. Define the question
question = "A 78-year-old Caucasian woman presented with..."
suffix = "\nPut your final answer in \\boxed{}."
messages = [{"role": "user", "content": question + suffix}]

# 3. Generate
input_ids = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, add_generation_prompt=True, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
outputs = model.generate(input_ids, max_new_tokens=8196, do_sample=False)
decoded_response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0][input_ids.shape[-1]:], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(decoded_response)
```

### Reasoning Process Quality

We evaluated the reasoning process across five dimensions: Logical Coherence, Factual Accuracy, Evidence Faithfulness, Interpretability & Clarity, and Information Utilization. MedCEG significantly outperforms baselines in producing clinically sound reasoning.
